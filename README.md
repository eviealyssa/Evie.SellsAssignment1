## Applied To All Pages
### Navigation  Bar
contains links to the following pages:
-   Home
-   Products 
-   Cart

The navigation bar is fully responsive â€“ it changes from a full menu to a hamburger menu when the screen size is below 768px.  When this happens, the links are hidden and are only shown when the hamburger icon is clicked. In addition, the shopping cart icon is hidden, and a worded link is displayed instead.

Other functions of the navigation bar include the current page being underlined, as well as the other page links being underlined when hovered over.

### Footer
The footer contains important details for the assignment, as well as contact information of the student union and the creator.

The footer utilises a grid to layout the different components, this grid is dynamic and changes column size depending on the size of the web page.

In addition, the social media icons act as links to the relevant student union social media.

### Accessibility and Usability
Examples of these accessibility features can be found in every page of the project. They have been clearly commented on the index page.

The project is accessible and usable in many ways.
It uses semantic elements such as <nav>, <footer>, and <section> as much as possible. These give meaning to the element and makes the code more readable.

In addition, each image and video have alternate text, giving a brief description of the element. This is in case the item doesn't load correctly, or the user can not view it, there is an alternate description. This is also used by screen readers. 

The project also makes use of headings (<h1> to <h6>), while only using <h1> as the top-level title. This helps to index the content and structure of the webpages.

Moreover, all text is clear and concise, avoiding special characters such as (* and -). This is to increase understanding and avoid characters which cannot be read by a screen reader. In addition, all abbreviations and slang words have been avoided, this increases the professionalism of the project. 

In addition, the project only uses certified web safe fonts. This ensures that every user has the same experience, with the same font display.

Furthermore, the document language is declared at the beginning of each html page. This is used by browsers and search engines so they can correctly display the information.
